**NOTE: Freya (and associated component libraries) has been archived for now. The ideas in Freya are still more than worthy of investigation, but the community adopted more conventional approaches to web development, making maintenance for Freya a challenge. For those who used Freya and contributed thoughts, encouragement, and code, thank you!**

**The ideas in Freya may well be resurrected at a later date, possibly on other platforms...** 

# Freya Optics
